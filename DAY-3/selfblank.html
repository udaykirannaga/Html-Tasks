        <p>In 1980, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicist" target="_self">physicist</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee" target="_blank" title="html inventor">Tim Berners-Lee</a>, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENQUIRE" target="_self">ENQUIRE</a>, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet" target="_blank" title="internet">internet</a>-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext" target="_self" title="Text">hypertext</a> system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_system" target="_blank">data systems</a> engineer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cailliau" target="_self" title="informatics engineer">Robert Cailliau</a> collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopedia" target="_blank">encyclopedia</a> is the first entry.</p>
